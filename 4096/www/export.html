            <p>I've built an all new 4096, maybe some of you already tried it in the earlier days, That's pretty fast and looks awesome.</p>
            <p>However, this upgrade is too huge that makes your best-score record and current play status unavailable, so I made this fallback release, in which you can save your current game status and get ready for the next upgrade.</p>
            <p>Just remember to push the button below before next upgrade, or you will lose everything.</p>
